# This version is better than Version3
# 
#
# Encapsulation:
# Mechanic encapsulates the details of bicycle preparation, making the system easier to maintain and extend.
# Reusability:

# The Mechanic can be reused in other contexts where bicycle preparation is needed.
# Reduced Coupling:

# Trip is not tightly coupled to the preparation logic, promoting flexibility and adherence to good design principles.
# This design ensures that any future changes in how bicycles are prepared will only affect the Mechanic class 
# and not the Trip class. Let me know if youâ€™d like additional refinements or a different language implementation!end
