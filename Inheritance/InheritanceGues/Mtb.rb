    # In Ruby, calling super without any arguments automatically forwards all the arguments 
    # received by the method (both positional and keyword) to the parent method. 
    # So if you haven't modified the keyword arguments, then just calling super will forward them as-is to Bicycle#initialize.
    # However, if you modify or merge the opts hash (for example, to provide a default value), you need to explicitly pass the modified hash using super(**opts) 
    # to ensure the parent initializer receives those changes.
    @front_shock = opts[:front_shock]
    @rear_shock = opts[:rear_shock]
    # @tire_size = opts[:tire_size]
    # The assignment for @tire_size here is redundant 
    # because super already did it in the parentâ€™s initialize.
    # You would only need to set it again in the subclass if you
    # intended to modify or override the behavior from the parent. 
    # Otherwise, it's best to let the parent class handle it.

# super 
# The super keyword is used in a child class to call a method of the same 
# name from its parent class.

# super(size: opts[:size])  # Pass only `:size` to `Bicycle#initialize`

# super() --> If you call super() with empty parentheses, 
# it does not forward any arguments to the parent method.

# The super keyword, when used without parentheses, 
# automatically forwards all arguments received by 
# the child method to the parent method, including:
# Positional arguments (if any).
# Keyword arguments (if the method uses **opts).
